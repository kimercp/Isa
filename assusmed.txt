Datagridview dgvDatabaseResults
------------------------
allow user to order column, and resize table
not allowed to edit column (add, delete, update) so its "read only"
I have left the header of column visible to make this table more clear to understand,
change mouse cursor for hand.
row header set as not visible
not allowed to user to resize rows (height)
multi select not allowed , user can select only one row
selection mode - fullRowSelect
allow user to add rows - set false
